# seed-lists

This repository is a reference for seeds of interest that I found using 
[cubiomes](https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes) for Minecraft Java Edition. 

## Contents

There is a document where I discuss how to find seeds with multiple quad-huts:
[many_quadhuts.md](https://github.com/Cubitect/seed-lists/blob/trunk/many_quadhuts.md).

Some tables with seeds with four or more quad-huts (1.16) are presented 
[here](https://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/Cubitect/seed-lists/blob/trunk/mqh_1_16.html).

Complete lists for double quad-huts within 20k blocks are located
[here](https://github.com/Cubitect/seed-lists/blob/trunk/dqh20k_1_12.txt) and 
[here](https://github.com/Cubitect/seed-lists/blob/trunk/dqh20k_1_16.txt) 
for 1.12 and 1.16 respectively. 
Note that the south-east quad-hut is barely in reach of the AFK spot in each of
those seeds and will require specialised farm designs to utilize fully. Also up
to 1.13 (inclusive) some of the quad-huts are unsuitable for farms because of
[MC-73051](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-73051).
